 Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions using diverse creative techniques and ideation methods

## BMAD Workflow Integration

This formula was auto-generated from a BMAD workflow. It enables:
- Bead-based state tracking (instead of frontmatter)
- Cross-session continuity via molecules
- Central monitoring via Gas Town

## Original Workflow Location
/Users/oliver/gt-bmad/bmad/polecats/furiosa/bmad/src/core/workflows/brainstorming

## Usage
1. Start the workflow: gt-bmad-workflow start brainstorming
2. Work through steps using bd ready / bd close <step>
3. Or use the original BMAD workflow for full interactive experience
